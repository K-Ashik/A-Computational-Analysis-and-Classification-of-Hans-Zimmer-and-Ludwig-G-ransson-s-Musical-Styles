# The Sonic Fingerprint: A Computational Analysis and Classification of Hans Zimmer and Ludwig Göransson's Musical Styles¶

## Introduction

In the landscape of modern film scoring, Hans Zimmer and Lüdwig Göransson stand as two of the most influential and recognizable composers. While both have crafted iconic and innovative soundscapes, their stylistic approaches are distinct. This project employs computational audio analysis and machine learning to move beyond subjective listening and quantitatively identify the unique characteristics that define their respective "sonic fingerprints."

By converting audio signals into a rich set of numerical features—representing timbre, harmony, rhythm, and texture—this analysis seeks to answer a central question: Can a machine learning model be trained to distinguish between the works of these two composers with high accuracy? Furthermore, by interpreting the model's results, we aim to pinpoint the specific musical elements that are the most powerful differentiators in their compositional styles.
